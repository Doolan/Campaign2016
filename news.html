		<p>"As many of you know, Presidential Hopeful Senator Escalera has dropped out of the presidential race. He choose Senator Emily Bochnowski as his replacement. I decided to sit down with Senator Bochnowski (And, later on, Senator Doolan) and find out a bit more on her political beliefs..."<br>
		</p>
		<p>
		"Bochnowski stated that see agrees with the Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey decisions, in that, abortions fall under a woman’s right to privacy. She continues with saying that no one can say “We know what you’re going through” unless they've gone through it themselves..."<br>
		</p><p>
		"No matter what degree a person may have, Bochnowski wants them to be working, not unemployed..."<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			"Overall, it seems that Senator Bochnowski will have a very easy time with this campaign. The Bochnowski/Doolan campaign, unsurprisingly, seems very middle of the road, which appeals to me, personally. I think they'll be able to bridge the gap between Republicans and Democrats, and, hopefully, get both sides working for a better tomorrow."

				"'We owe ourselves an America we can be proud of', words of advice by former Senator Morgan Escalera and his running mate, Republican Congressman Steven Doolan. After the sad loss of his wife, Mr. Escalera chose to respect her wishes and run for president. His talk of welfare reform caught not only my attention, but also the attention of hard working Americans waiting for a change. The Democratic Party has found itself a duo that could ultimately bring the U.S. back to its glory days of having a thriving economy through balancing the welfare system." (

		"Boston native and 2016 democratic presidential candidate, Morgan Escalara, made quite a splash when he announced he would be running with Republican Congressman Steven Doolan. Escalara, a Harvard-educated Massachusetts lawyer with a Peace Corps past, and Doolan, a mid-western software engineer with a history in Homeland Security, are quite the unconventional duo. Their platform involved both liberal goals such as maintaining our public educations system as well as typically conservative goals such as locking down borders. A focus on protecting the US from cyberterrorism as well as traditional forms of terrorism was emphasized." (
