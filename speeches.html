		<p class="Morgan">
			I Morgan Escalera would like to officially announce my candidacy for the President of the United States of America. A native of the east side of Boston, I went to college at the  California Institute of Technology before attending Harvard Law School and passing the Bar exam in my home state of Massachusetts. I then decided to serve my fellow man and enrolled in the Peace corps. It was there that I met my lovely wife Elizabeth.
		</p>
		<p class="Morgan">
			After the peace corps, I decided to enact change domestically and run for Congress in massachusetts. This began a very successful career in the House, first as a congressman, then as a senator on the foreign affairs committee, then as your minority leader. While I enjoyed my time in the house, I was driven to seek this distinct position by my wife. Killed by a drunk driver six months ago, she left me with our 6-year old daughter lily. She always wanted me to run for president in order to share my ideas with the world, and in her memory I am doing just that. In the face of convention, i have chosen as my running mate a Republican, the honorable congressman from Ohio, Steven Doolan.
		</p>
		<p class="Steven">
			I am an Ohio Native, being born and raised in Hyde park. The district I now serve. After high school I left my home state to Attend Northwestern University to pursue a degree in Software Engineering. After college, I went straight to work, taking a job defending our national interests at the Department of Homeland Security.
		</p>
		<p class="Steven">
			While I found my work incredibly rewarding, I grew frustrated with the increasing levels of red tape and bureaucracy. This leave my job and run for congress, Where I served on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. I made headways into fixing problems, but I found myself having to constantly navigate political barriers.
		</p>
		<p class="Steven">
			Throughout my live I have learned one thing:
			<br/>
			America is no longer the greatest country on Earth. There no longer exists a greatest country that other countries aspire to be. Petty in fighting between Democrat and Republican majorities has deprived America of that position.
		</p>
		<p class="Morgan">
			But with an <strong>American Majority</strong>
			we can rise to former heights. We can once again be the shinning example of how democracy should work. We can strike fear in our enemies regimes by showing their repressed citizens that freedom does work. And that they to can be free.
		</p>
		<p class="Morgan">We owe that to the world.</p>
		<p class="Steven">
			But we also owe ourselves an America that we can be proud of.
		</p>
		<p class="Steven">
			We need to reform welfare to where it no longer perpetuates an endless cycle, but gives Hard Working Americans enough help so they can lift themselves out of poverty.
		</p>
		<p class="Morgan">
			We need to maintain faith in our public education system. There once was a time, not too long ago, when American public schools were the pinnacle of education. This can be the case again.
		</p>
		<p class="Steven">
			We need to lock down our borders and protect against terror in both traditional and cyber forms. We need to guarantee the safety of Americans while respect their rights.
		</p>
		<p class="Morgan">
			But above all we need to leave this country better than we found it, for our children and our grandchildren. We as Americans owe it to them to make this country great once again.

			For a decade, the United States has made fighting terrorism its main foreign policy goal. This is by definition a reactionary policy and is limited in focus, without a global vision or sense of determinacy. As President, I will change our foreign policy goals in order to pursue a larger purpose. There is a very famous JFK quote that i am sure you are all aware of.  “And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.” That quote has been ingrained in the minds of virtually every American, and it speaks to the patriotism that makes this country great. However, there is another part of that quote that is often forgotten, and it states
			<br\></p>
		<p>
			“ My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.” It is this sentiment that I choose to embrace, the concept of a global community fighting for the freedom of men and women everywhere. It is time to think not only for American interests, but for global interests. In Russia, there is a massive tension brewing, and the Russian people are caught in the crossfire. African nations such as Ethiopia are showing the Western world that Africa is ready to reach the global stage once again, and closer to home Mexico is in dire need of our help, not only because they are hurting but because their problems will soon become ours. This is a dream that goes beyond party lines and appeals to the human nature than lives within us all.
			<br\></p>
		<p>
			For too long we have let Russian relations fall to the wayside in lieu of idealistic grandstanding.  Russia’s feud with a U.S led coalition have tarnished the worlds image and  we will only do more damage if we continue with the course that we are on. This great country is on the precipice of a second cold war. We as a country must understand that the Russia that we are dealing with now is a completely different monster than the USSR that we demonized for half of a century. Russia is no longer controlled by a tyrannical madman, but by an elected official who has degraded himself to an extreme isolationist out of desperation. We must accept that the sanctions against the Russia developed by the United States and its NATO European allies were too effective, collapsing the Russian economy to the point of near worthlessness.
			<br\></p>
		<p>
			The Russian people are caught in the middle of two superpowers playing chicken. When they see their extremely poor quality of living and their collapsing economy, they blame not their oppressive government but looming specter of over-reaching Western powers. As President, i will warm the frigid relations with Russia so that we can resolve our cultural issues more diplomatically rather than through military grandstanding, as has been the case far too often recently. The recent attacks on the Ukraine should not go unpunished surely, but there must exist another way to right the ship than to bankrupt the russian people. Alternative options must be explored. 	We must strike fear into our enemies regimes by proving to them that freedom does work. Russia is not the villainous threat it once was. Our emissaries and policies represent the United States of America and its values, and this is not what we should stand for. The freedom of mankind is not ours to regulate, but rather to help flourish.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the world changes around us, as is the case with the Russia, America must be able to adapt to the changing world. That is why we must be capable of not only leading by our own free ideas, but to acknowledge and encourage the strides that other nations are making to that effect. Ethiopia has emerged from the Horn of Africa as a free and democratic regional power who is enacting positive change throughout the Eastern parts of the continent. Africa has long been considered an underdeveloped area,  available to anyone who wishes to exploit its resources. If it was not for countries such as Ethiopia emerging as a leader for the region, the continent would eternally fall into distress, requiring foreign aid.
			<br\></p>
		<p>
			By promoting freedom through financial aid to troops and other humanitarian means,Ethiopia establishes itself an example for what the other nations in the region should aspire to become. Funding from NGO’s destined for any part of Africa flow through Ethiopia, as well as the governing humanitarian body of the continent. In the Somalian Civil War it was Ethiopian ground troops that halted the bloodshed, with the aid of the United States Fifth Fleet. Following the events of the genocide in Darfur, representatives of both sides met in the Ethiopian capital to discuss the peace that would follow. These actions and other like them that Ethiopia have undertaken are reminiscent of the America of old, providing a leading hand in the creation of the United Nations after the horror of World War II and being the voice of temperance in environmental issues over the past twenty years.
			<br\></p>
		<p>
			The men and women of Ethiopia look past their cultural differences to create a thriving and stable economy, independent of foreign aid. They have expanded upon this to aid neighboring countries in times of distress. It is this independant Africa led by example that is the takeaway for the average American. When a job needs to be accomplished, the people of the United States need to look past their differences, and work towards the common good. There must be a shift in ideology among the American people that they need not be involved in every issue for it to be in the best interest of the world.
			<br\></p>
		<p>
			Even close to home, our foreign policy has floundered in our hunt to root out foreign terrorists. Our closest neighbor to the south, Mexico, is a sore spot on our foreign standing. Mexico and illegal Mexican immigrants have been the butt of many jokes recently, but has anyone making those jokes stopped to consider why they are fleeing their homeland to face persecution and ridicule here? It is because they are fighting a war down there, one that is a lot closer to home and claiming many more lives than the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Mexican government has been waging a seemingly endless war with the drug cartels in the area since 2006.It is estimated that there have been 120,000 casualities of war, not including over 25,000 non-combatants who have disappeared, compared to the 7,000 american troops that were lost during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. Even though some of the most violent regions of the conflict are dangerously close to the U.S border, the policy of the United States is to turn a blind eye to the internal conflict occurring in our sister to the South, dealing only with the trafficking directly affecting the United States. If elected, this would no longer be the case. Before there was a War on Terror, there was a War on Drugs, and it is time to show the world that this will not stand. The United States will stand firmly with the Mexican government, supplying them with the tools they need to succeed over the cartels, whether that may be economic assistance by promoting free trade, exchange of goods and ideas to grow the economy to the point where there are good, legal  jobs to be found in Mexico or to bring American boots on the ground to deal with the cartels more directly. This will be a key issue of my administration solely because it is the responsibility of neighbors who have stable and fruitful economies and governments such as the United States to help those countries affected by hostile powers.
			<br\></p>
		<p>
			America stands on the brink of something truly great, with an impressive track record of accomplishments of times past. It is time to move forward from the single-minded chase indicative of the War on Terror, to something larger than that, larger even than ourselves. The United States of America has the opportunity to establish itself as the global guardian of the freedom of mankind. We can strike fear in our enemies regimes not only by a show of force but also by showing their citizens that freedom does work. Through finding new free and prosperous allies we can improve the conditions in which our fellow man lives everywhere. Finally when the times call for it, America as a force must be ready to bare its teeth to fight those who stand against freedom, not solely terrorists but syndicated criminal organizations. It is the belief of this administration that these goals are ones that we as Americans owe the world as the sole remaining superpower. We can continue forward deeper into the 21st century not just as Americans, but as leaders in a global community committed to the freedom of man, as envisioned half a century ago. That can happen, and we can make it possible. “For you, for me, for America.”
