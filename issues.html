		Education is one of the essential building blocks of America. A strong education system is essential in order to progress our nation as a whole. Previous administration’s reforms have had damaging consequences, and the focus needs to be drawn back to what matters most and that is helping educate the youth of America. Through adding technology into the classrooms and pushing for more funding to be allotted to schools, no school will be without the resources needed to function at its highest ability.
	</p>
	<p>
		High quality resources need to be implemented with teacher’s who are performing to their highest ability. We aspire to live in country where our students want to become teaches and as such will establish block grants for teachers willing to further their education.  We want there to be more flexibility in order to adjust for specific classrooms by handing control back to the states. By allowing teachers to make more individualized curriculum and not teach to a standardized testing such as the Common Core, students will progress fundamentally as well as with critical thinking skills. The public education system should be allowing students to reach their highest ability, no matter where they begin their educational journey.
	</p>
	<p>
		A student should not have to travel an extended distance, or travel to another district because they feel they are not receiving a quality education in the district they reside. By eliminating school vouchers, students will have to attend the school in their district. This is not a punishment to the students, but rather an ultimatum for the schools to reach their greatest potential and provide the highest quality education possible.

		There are far too many young adults leaving college with debt but no jobs. The government is partly responsible for this by promoting and subsidizing degrees that don’t yield jobs. In order for America to once again become an economic powerhouse, Americans must be trained to fill both the jobs of today and the jobs of tomorrow. We must realize that the America today is not the America of yesterday, and the importance of quality 4 year degree is can not be understated.. In order to bring about this change federal subsidies and loans need to be redirected from a solely need basis to a system that relies on need, but also the prospect awaiting a graduate in that field.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order for America to unify and rebuild, we need to be able to come together. We need to reinvest in our national infrastructure. There are more vehicles on the roads and the roads are showing wear and tear. By expanding and fixing the national interstate system we can create jobs and allow American to spend more time living and less time traveling. We also need to invest modern transportation and take risks on projects such as Hyperloop and bullet trains. We need to work with private companies and expand systems of Superchargers to allow for green transportation, and support American corporations as they continue to innovate.
	</p>
	<p>
		We also need to take care of our hardworking Americans already at work. Every American has the right to work, and we should pursue Right to Work legislation at a federal level to protect hard working Americans. Every person should be able to chose whether or not to join a union and have dues taken from their paycheck. Unions have become increasing political at the expense of the constituents. Right to work laws creates competition to unions and allows their members to hold the unions responsible. Quality unions have nothing to fear, and the quality of all unions will improve. Better unions means better employer worker relations and better jobs.

	<p>
		The United States Welfare program is broken and in dire need of reform. The current system creates a cycle where too many Americans get stuck in poverty, and a few take advantage of the system. The country is better off when neighbors are helping neighbors. By setting a community service requirement to draw unemployment benefits, we will put the unemployed to work cleaning parks, running soup kitchens and bettering America. Shortening the max time of unemployment insurance will put more pressure on people to find a job and by providing the underemployed with temporary assistance we can help keep families afloat as they pull themselves up.Through offering day care subsidies for those who work yet still earn an income below the threshold we can get more people working and help them continue to make ends meet.
	</p>
	<p>
		If we similarly follow the guidelines of the PRWORA act of 1996 and increase block grants so that we can continue to reform our national welfare system. Raising the poverty line is something that needs to happen. This is no longer 1960. The average family no longer spends one third of their income on food. More people are in poverty than those recognized by our current measurement standards.  We should recognize those in need and give them the help they need.These steps can help create America a better and more productive country.

	<p>
		The United States has eroded its public image worldwide for too long. We must strengthen our relationship with the troubled EU, by once again providing support to our NATO allies in the Euro Zone. Starting with the recent Great Recession, and coming to a head with our housing bubble collapse, faith in the United States currency plummeted, and ultimately has left most of the Euro Zone struggling with their debt problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		This also applies to our enemies overseas. Foreign powers such as the Republic of North Korea, Iran, and Russia have grandstanded against the United States to no end. Tougher economic and political sanctions must be used against these and other powers that do not abide by the freedom offered by the American Dream. Military action should be used only at the most dire situations, but should not be shirked from when dealing with these tyrannical powers.
	</p>
	<p>
		There should be a continued and financially fruitful relationship with the Chinese, but we should enforce our influence to promote more progressive social issues with the Chinese. Points such as the Umbrella Revolution and the independence of Taiwan highlight the need for foreign intervention in Chinese social policies.
	</p>
	<p>
		More generally, the United States must improve its public image. Many recent polls in underdeveloped nations and among the populace of our most trusted allies have found the American People and the US as a whole, is viewed in a negative light. That image can be changed, by both increased humanitarian aid to third world countries and greater tact in dealing with foreign powers, especially those located in the Middle East. American foreign policy has often been painted as the world’s police, a fair portrait. The United States as a policing force can make great strides towards being a more positive role model for the world, and it is the belief of this administration that this goal is achievable.

</div>
<div class="mainText" id="cyberSecurity">
	<p>
		With a huge portion in this country’s infrastructure attached to and accessible from the internet, there is a huge vulnerability for damage from foreign and domestic cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks pose a grave threat to our economy and national defense.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Defense Department as well as multi-department team including the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) has been working on several initiatives to help prevent and limit exposure to these disastrous possibilities. They are currently limited by a lack of manpower, as well as a lack of qualified applicants to fill positions that would be created in the department if it were expanded. By adding government scholarships for stem in Software and Computer Engineering as well as creating specialized programs similar to ROTC the government can fill the gap.
	</p>
	<p>
		Much of our defense can be automatized and be shared out to the private sector without limiting posing a threat to national security. Two of the government's most successful projects in this field are the Einstein 2 and Einstein 3 projects. Einstein 2 is autonomous self-learning machine that takes a snapshot of any issues and sends the data back to the government for analysis. This procedure is minimally invasive and sends little to no personal information and then for good measure is scrubbed to remove the remaining personal data. Einstein 3 aims to shoot down attacks before it gets to the target. Both of these programs should be made available as an opt in option for companies of a certain size on a case by case basis. Doing this would expand the rate at which the programs self-learn and help protect both the private industry and make our infrastructure more secure, and that is why this is one of the pinnacles of our administration.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to bolstering our defense, we need to stem the rate of attacks. Because of the real danger posed by cyberattacks, they should be considered an act of war when committed by foreign governments, and acts of terror by any non-military persons. Countries harboring these terrorists should be held accountable for their actions.

		America's immigration system is broken, it is in desperate need of reform. Instead of allowing more and more illegal immigrants to come into our country and take our jobs we should crack down on border security. Not only will this preserve the current jobs for Americans, but it will allocate more potential jobs, both for those immigrating legally and our domestic poor. The United States can no longer stand back and let our borders be overrun by illegal aliens, but even more so it cannot sit idly by while criminal elements walk freely through our borders. That is why one of the most important things will be to focus on streamlining the deportation process in order to crack down more effectively on those who go back and forth along the border constantly.  This change should not be so drastic that we immediately deport all illegal aliens. The DREAM Act should still be implemented to integrate the children of illegal immigrants. The follies of their parents should not restrict the children from a chance at achieving the American Dream.

		We as Americans should be continuously trying to decrease our global environmental footprint. We should be trying to leave this world to our children better than we found it. In order for this to happen we need to focus on global warming and promoting clean energies. Global Warming can be stopped only with a collaborative effort from all of the world’s countries. The United States can be the trend setter for the rest of the developed world.
	</p>
	<p>
		Through seeking cleaner energy alternatives we can better our country by creating jobs and creating the need for more college graduates and better the world around us by preserving the inherent beauty in the natural world. Wind and nuclear power are proven forms of clean energy that are also very cost effective. Through building on current Cap and Trade programs we can continue to create more clean energy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not only should we pursue new forms of clean energy but we should also work to improve current forms of energy. The current ethanol requirements in gasoline is hurting more than it is helping. It would be more effective to mandate that all cars and light-duty trucks have an average of 40 mpg highway rating over the course of 20 years. The use of ethanol in gasoline greatly depletes the amount of corn that we have for food and it is also proven that by adding ethanol the amount of carbon dioxide emissions entering the atmosphere does not decrease.
	</p>
	<p>
		Coal has been a major source of energy for hundreds of years and with new technology we can burn coal with far less harmful emissions. Clean Carbon systems are being developed and could be a major breakthrough in engineering and science. With the use of clean carbon systems we can better our future while still maintaining jobs in the coal industry. It should be noted that coal, even clean coal systems, can only be a stop-gap in the fight against global warming.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is a fight that all nations, the entire world, can and should unite behind and it is the U.S’s responsibility, not only as global superpower but as the main proponent of increased carbon emission in the 20th century, to lead the charge.
